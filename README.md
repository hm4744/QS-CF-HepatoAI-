## What is HepatoAI?

**HepatoAI** is a lightweight electroanalytical decision-support platform developed to translate experimentally derived calibration relationships of the QS|CF microsensor into a deployable digital diagnostic interface. The platform enables rapid interpretation of electrochemical signals for therapeutic drug monitoring of hepatotoxic drugs including **acetaminophen (APAP)** and **diclofenac (DCF)**.

HepatoAI converts chronoamperometric current responses obtained from the QS|CF microsensor into **quantitative drug concentrations and clinically interpretable outputs**. By embedding experimentally validated calibration equations within a computational framework, the platform provides **real-time concentration estimation and classification into therapeutic, low, or elevated ranges**, enabling rapid analytical interpretation without manual post-processing.

• Automated conversion of current (µA) to drug concentration (µM)  
• Clinically interpretable outputs (therapeutic / low / elevated)  
• Lightweight smartphone-compatible analytical interface  
• Deterministic analytical engine based on experimental calibration  
• AI-assisted prompt-to-code development workflow

# Analytical Framework

HepatoAI operates using experimentally derived calibration relationships obtained from **chronoamperometric measurements of the QS|CF microsensor in diluted serum environments**.

### Acetaminophen (APAP)
I = 0.05973C + 0.2934

### Diclofenac (DCF)
I = 0.00467C + 0.23693

Where:

- **I** = measured current (µA)  
- **C** = analyte concentration (µM)

The application determines concentration using the inverse calibration transformation:
C = (I − b) / m


This deterministic computation removes the need for runtime regression fitting and ensures full consistency with the **experimentally validated electroanalytical calibration model**.

# Development Workflow

HepatoAI was developed through an **AI-assisted iterative prototyping workflow** in which the electroanalytical logic of the QS|CF sensing platform was progressively translated into executable software architecture.
The development process involved successive **prompt–refinement cycles using ChatGPT**, where sensing logic, calibration equations, and analytical computation were systematically converted into modular code segments. These modules were integrated to construct the final application using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.
Interface prototyping, debugging, and real-time logic testing were performed using **CodePen**, allowing rapid validation of signal input handling, concentration calculation, and clinical classification logic prior to deployment.
The finalized codebase was subsequently packaged into a **smartphone-installable application format**, enabling portable diagnostic deployment and real-time analytical interpretation.
